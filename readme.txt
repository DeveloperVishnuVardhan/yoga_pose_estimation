Project Description:
Abstract—The proposed project aims to develop a deep learning-based pose estimation model to accurately identify, track
and provide feedback for yoga poses in real time. The model will utilize a camera to capture the user’s image, and a pose
estimation algorithm will identify the different parts of the body such as the arms, legs, torso, etc., to determine the yoga pose
being performed. This project aims to help yoga practitioners improve their form and integrate the model into fitness apps
and wearables to provide a more immersive yoga experience. The expected outcome is a highly accurate and efficient model that
can benefit the yoga community. The developed system can also detect incorrect yoga postures and advise the user to improve the
pose by specifying where the pose is going wrong. The project also presents several approaches to pose estimation and all approaches
can be easily extended to a different use case.
